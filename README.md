# NSClientJS
NSClientJS is a Web App, hosted at [nsclientjs.schubi.wtf](https://nsclientjs.schubi.wtf/), that displays blood sugar values from your NightScout instance.
All Data is handled on Client side, in you Browser. It only consists of some html, css and js Code.
Even the Settings (e.g. your NightScout Token) are only saved in your Browsers local Storage. No Settings or any BG-Data are ever sent to the Server.
It is even possible to download this Repository, unpack it on your Phone or PC and run it by simply opening the local index.html in your Browser.
